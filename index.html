    <h2 title="My personal favorite!">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</h2>
    <p>Kanye's 5th studio album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was a critically acclaimed masterpiece.<br>
    It was masterfully orchestrated and produced. Kanye brought together the biggest names in the<br>
    rap industry and came out with numerous hits that impacted the whole industry. This album is listed<br>
    as the third best album of all time in the Rolling Stone list.</p>

    <h2>The Life of Pablo</h2>
    <p>This is Kanye's 2016 album. The album is a personal statement about Kanye being torn between god and<br>
    family, or the party life. Tracks like Waves and Father Stretch My Hands were perfect summer sounds, with<br>
    No More Parties in LA and Saint Pablo having memorable lyrics and flow. Kanye did a worldwide tour upon<br>
    release of the album, although it got cancelled midway through due to Kanye's declining mental condition.<br>
    The Life of the Pablo album title comes from three different "Pablos". Pablo Escabor, Pablo Picasso and<br>
    Saint Paulo. Each representing drugs, art, and religion.</p>

    <h2>Donda</h2>
    <p>Donda is Kanye's 10th studio album released in 2021. The album is a dedication to Kanye's mother whome<br>
    Kanye had admiration for greatly. The album was a mixture of gospel, rap, and experimental. Kanye held three<br>
    listening parties to get realtime feedback from the audience to shape his album. The album turned out great<br>
    with sounds never heard of before and Kanye once again pushing the boundries. Shortly after the release of the<br>
    album Kanye held a joint concert with Drake finally squashing their long-lasting beef. The concert was a huge<br>
    success.</p>
