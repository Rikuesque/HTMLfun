    <img src="media/download.jpeg" style="float:right;width:100px;height:100px;margin:20px;">
    Kanye's 5th studio album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was a critically acclaimed masterpiece.
    It was masterfully orchestrated and produced. Kanye brought together the biggest names in the
    rap industry and came out with numerous hits that impacted the whole industry. This album is listed
    as the <strong>third best album of all time</strong> in the Rolling Stones list.

    <h2>The Life of Pablo</h2>
    <p>
    <img src="media/tlop.jpg" style="float:left;width:100px;height:100px;margin-right:20px;">
    This is Kanye's 2016 album. The album is a personal statement about Kanye being torn between god and
    family, or the party life. Tracks like Waves and Father Stretch My Hands were perfect summer sounds, with
    No More Parties in LA and Saint Pablo having memorable lyrics and flow. Kanye did a worldwide tour upon
    release of the album, although it got cancelled midway through due to Kanye's <strong>declining mental condition</strong>.
    The Life of the Pablo album title comes from three different "Pablos". Pablo Escabor, Pablo Picasso and
    Saint Paulo. Each representing drugs, art, and religion.

    Donda is Kanye's 10th studio album released in 2021. The album is a dedication to Kanye's mother whome
    Kanye had admiration for greatly. The album was a mixture of gospel, rap, and experimental. Kanye held three
    listening parties to get realtime feedback from the audience to shape his album. The album turned out great
    with sounds never heard of before and Kanye once again <strong>pushing the boundries</strong>. Shortly after the release of the
    album Kanye held a joint concert with Drake finally squashing their long-lasting beef. The concert was a huge
    success.
